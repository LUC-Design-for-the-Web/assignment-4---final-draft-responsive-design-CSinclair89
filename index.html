					<p>My name is Chris Sinclair and I'm an artist who specializes in animation, music, guitar, and 
				dance. I have a Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Digital Media from Kendall College of Art & Design 
				with a focus on 2D and 3D animation. I'm currently employed at and attending Loyola University in Chicago 
				to work towards a B.S. in Computer Science, aiming to graduate in spring of 2024. It is my goal to one day apply my talents in some capacity that pertains to coding in some form or another. I've grown passionate about 
				programming and aim to eventually build a career for myself out of it.</p>
